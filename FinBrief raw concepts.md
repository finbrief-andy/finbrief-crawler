FinBrief ‚Äî Concept Overview

1. Core Idea

FinBrief is a financial intelligence app that collects, refines, and transforms raw financial news into actionable investment strategies.

Data ingestion: Crawl and aggregate financial news from multiple trusted sources (e.g., Finnhub, VnExpress, CNBC, MarketWatch, Cafef, Bloomberg).

Transformation: Deduplicate, clean, and normalize articles; summarize content using NLP; enrich with metadata (category, asset type, stock code, country).

Analysis: Apply sentiment analysis (e.g., FinBERT) and impact scoring to understand the potential effect of news on markets and assets.

Strategy generation: Fine-tune NLP models to automatically generate Action Strategies that help investors make better short-term and long-term decisions.

2. Action Strategies

The key differentiator of FinBrief is its ability to provide structured Action Strategies at different time horizons:

Daily Strategy ‚Üí Aggregate the day‚Äôs news and provide tactical recommendations for the next 24 hours.

Weekly Strategy ‚Üí Summarize the week‚Äôs trends and generate actionable insights for the upcoming week.

Monthly Strategy ‚Üí Capture larger economic and sector-wide trends, including macroeconomic indicators.

Yearly Strategy ‚Üí Deliver big-picture outlooks and long-term investment guidance.

Each strategy combines:

Sentiment signals (positive/negative/neutral) from news.

Market behavior (price movement, derivatives, unusual trading activities).

Institutional actions (buying/selling trends from organizations, proprietary desks, foreign investors).

3. Asset Coverage

At launch, FinBrief focuses on three core asset classes (most relevant for Vietnamese investors and globally scalable):

Stocks ‚Äî with emphasis on key tickers (e.g., VN30, blue-chip US stocks).

Support for stock code (ACB, TCB, AAPL, etc.) and country (VN, US, ‚Ä¶).

Track daily trading data, derivatives, and unusual activities.

Gold ‚Äî global and domestic gold price trends and forecasts.

Real Estate ‚Äî macro-level housing market signals, policy impacts, and project-level insights.

(Other asset types like forex, crypto, and savings may be added later, but the core focus is stocks, gold, and real estate.)

4. Data Categorization

Each news item is enriched with structured metadata for easier filtering, aggregation, and training:

property_type: stock / gold / real_estate

stock_code: e.g., "ACB", "TCB"

stock_country: e.g., "VN", "US"

tags: extracted entities, sectors, or macro topics

This structured approach enables FinBrief to later deliver focused insights for specific stocks, sectors, or asset classes.

5. User Value Proposition

Investors: Get daily/weekly/monthly action strategies instead of raw, overwhelming news.

Traders: Receive timely buy/sell/hold signals backed by sentiment + market data.

Long-term holders: Understand macro trends in gold, real estate, and stock markets.

Analysts/Professionals: Use the refined data, sentiment labels, and strategies to complement their research.

6. Differentiation from Existing Platforms

Unlike traditional financial portals (Fingroup, WiChart, Cafef) that mainly provide raw data or charts, FinBrief:

Summarizes news into concise, human-friendly content.

Adds intelligence via NLP-based sentiment and impact analysis.

Generates actionable strategies across multiple time horizons.

Focuses on Vietnamese + Global context for relevant cross-market insights.

üëâ In short: FinBrief is a ‚ÄúBloomberg mini + AI layer‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt just show you the news, but tells you what to do next with your investments.
