FinBrief – AI-driven Action Strategy Platform

1. Problem

Investors are overwhelmed: thousands of headlines daily, across dozens of sites.

Most platforms provide raw news, not clear action plans.

Retail investors in Vietnam lack a localized, affordable, AI-driven tool like Bloomberg.

Result:

Wasted time scanning multiple sources.

Missed signals in the noise.

Decisions driven by fragmented data instead of clear strategies.

2. Solution: FinBrief

FinBrief delivers one single strategy page per day, week, month, and year.

Daily Strategy Page → Short-term trading and alerts.

Weekly Strategy Page → Portfolio positioning and key market drivers.

Monthly Strategy Page → Sector and macro trends.

Yearly Strategy Page → Big-picture outlook and risk management.

Each strategy page includes:

AI-generated summary of market drivers.

Action recommendations (buy/sell/hold, hedge, reallocate).

Links to detailed news analysis for users who want to dig deeper.

👉 Investors only need to read one page per day to stay ahead.
